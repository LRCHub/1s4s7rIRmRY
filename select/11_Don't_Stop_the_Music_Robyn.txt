This little girl didn't care what anybody said
She got the whole world dancing to the music in her head
They loved to trash her bad
Laugh at her and call her names, ah yeah
And now they all try to copy her, isn't that a shame
It, it all just made her stronger

Don't stop, stop the music
The world will keep turning if you use it
Get out there and don't stop, stop the music
People keep dancing
You can do it
Baby come on
Baby come on

He knew that he was different
This sucker couldn't win
They didn't dig his vision
They tried to fit him in
But there's no room for losers
Until they make you change
And then you love them
Tell me how much longer

Don't stop, stop the music
The world will keep turning if you use it
Get out there and
Don't stop, stop the music
People keep dancing
You can do it
Baby come on (Don't stop, don't stop the music)
Baby come on (Don't stop, don't stop the music)

You've got a perfect body, you've got a perfect smile
You're unlike anybody, got your own shine, come on
If you just keep on dancing, then you won't feel no pain
Baby it's your decision, only you can break the chain, yeah

So all you gotta do is dance, come on

Music like love floating in the air
You can reach out grab it everywhere
Showing you you're special (Baby come on)
You were put here on earth to make goodness for people (Baby come on)
Better make it worth living while the world's still spinning, come on!

Don't stop, stop the music
The world will keep turning if you use it, baby come on
Don't stop, stop the music
Keep on dancing, you can do it
Baby come on (Don't stop, don't stop the music)
Baby come on (Don't stop, don't stop the music)
Baby come on

Don't stop, stop the music
Keep on dancing, you can do it
Baby come on
